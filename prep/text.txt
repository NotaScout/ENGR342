Im not sure why not all components are importing into the PCB editiro correctly

None of the schematic nets show up when Im assigning nets in PCB editor

Set Netclasses in Schematic (any named) by right click > assign netclass, most are not neccesary to sassign, because they are default, and don't need to be impedance matched
