For the following project we will be using the Expressif ESP32-S2 to create a microcontroller capable of transcieving 2.4GHz WiFi signals. 

After our first draft revsions, we have added zeners across the data+/- pins and raw power VBUS pins to ground. These will theoretically keep our current within acceptable limits.

Additionally, by popular request we have added an 8MB SRAM chip to allow for increased functionality. I also thought it would be cool to have headroom for more complexity.
